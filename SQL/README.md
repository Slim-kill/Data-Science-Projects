The aim of this project was to find some insights into the IT job market. The IT industry has expanded at an overwhelming rate and new jobs titles are seemingly created every day. This project answers three questions:

Key Questions:
1. Is there a distortion of income based on gender?
2. What categories do popular IT companies fall into? Where are majority of these industries located?
3. What programming languages do professionals use and what combinations are prominent?

Key Findings:
1. The difference in income among male and female workers have been widely discussed. This data shows that although male workers generally earn more, they also have more experience compared to female workers. For instance, in the lower management level, the male workers had an average of 11.9 years of experience while their female counterparts has 9.6 years.
